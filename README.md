# My Love â€“ Romantic Interactive Web Animation

**My Love** is a creative web animation project built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript using the Canvas API. It generates a full-screen visual of cascading "I love you" messages with interactive pink "My Love" explosions on click.

This project was originally designed as a digital love letter and is now shared as a polished example of creative coding and Canvas-based animation.

## Features

- Fullscreen canvas animation with responsive design.
- Uniform falling rows of "I love you" text across the entire screen.
- On mouse click, animated pink particle explosions spelling "My Love".
- Smooth animation using `requestAnimationFrame`.
- Clean and minimalist implementation using plain JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Canvas API)

## How It Works

- The canvas fills the entire browser window.
- Rows of "I love you" text scroll downward in synchronized horizontal lines, filling the screen like digital rain.
- Clicking anywhere on the canvas triggers a burst of pink "My Love" texts that fade out over time.
- The effect is continuous and designed for both desktop and mobile environments.
