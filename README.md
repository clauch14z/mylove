# 💖 My Love - Romantic Interactive Web Animation

**My Love** is a small interactive web project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the Canvas API. It creates a beautiful, heartfelt experience where the screen fills with cascading "I love you" messages, and clicking anywhere triggers a pink explosion of the words **"My Love"**.

This project was originally made as a digital love letter 💌, and is now shared as an open source creative web animation.
